## Welcome to the Semantic MediaWiki repository!
Semantic MediaWiki (SMW) is also a full-fledged frameork, in conjunction with many spinoff extensions, that can turn a wiki into a powerful and flexible knowledge management system. All data created within Semantic MediaWiki can easily be exported or published via the Semantic Web, allowing other systems to use this data seamlessly.
